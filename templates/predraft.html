              flat in the second half. Partially due to injuries, partially do to people running out of gas.
              He still comes in as next year's favorite to win the title. Don't expect to see him in week 15 with his boom
              or bust nature - he'll either have a bye or miss the playoffs. </td>

                last year- consistent in the first part, dominate in the second half before the finals with a few STINKERS mixed in.
                He's been a contender 2 of the last 4 years and hopes once again to challenge for a title.

              <td>The second of the "one-year-wonders". Can a sub .500 team win a champiosnship? Possible, but unlikely
                  (empirically once in 7 years). Will Matt have another sub .500 regular season? Not saying he will, but he has for the 
                  past 4 years. In PPR, Matty Ice has also never finished the regular season above 5th. Last year he snuck into the playoffs but caught lightening in a bottle when it mattered the most.
                  The odds are stacked against Matty Ice to defend his title, but I'm not going to discount the possiblity. </td>

                  Since then however he's cooled off, with barely missing the playoffs next year and a poor showing in the quarterfinals last year. 
                  Over the years, David has shown a consistent floor with contending level upside.  </td>

                years in the league, he only has 1 playoff win. Last year SZN looked to be a threat until a Henry injury
                derailed his season. Look for SZN to bounce back this year, but his lack of prior playoff
                success makes it harder to make a case for him year after year.

                Bucci has the ablility to turn back the time machine into his dominant days, but until then he'll
                dwell in the home he has made in the bottom of the rankings.  </td>

              this year. The main question for Sam is focus. It seems like he manages his team from a different country every year.
              If Sam can put in the time he'll turn it around, but he needs to show something this season.</td>
